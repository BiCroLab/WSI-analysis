## Software used
* vips
* exiftool
* bioimage converter

## Pipeline
### Segmentation
.svs files and .nd2 files need to be processed differently. 
* svs files can be all processed in qupath 
* small nd2 files (< 2GB) can be processed in qupath directly
* large nd2 files (> 2GB) are converted into tif, split into vertical chuncks and then processed in qupath 
### Morphology table
The morphology table is the one generated by qupath 
### Graph
Is the 1-simplex originated by UMAP in the uniform manifold approximation step. It allows to quantify the weighted degree and the clustering coefficients.
### Graph Laplacian of the morphology
By constructing the graph Laplacian we can measure the differential structure of morphological and topological features
### Selection of relevant morphological and topological features
Decide which features to include in the downstream analysis
### Normalization of the feature set
Normalize features in order to have a meaningful inter-feature comparison. Some have values in the range [0,1] (like circularity and eccentricity), others have values in a different range (like area, perimeter, intensinsity, etc).
### PCA of the feature matrix
Find the major direction of variations in the data
### Projection on real space of the principal components
Picture the spatial distribution of the principal components
### Partitioning of reals space based on projected components
Find spatio-morphological communities
### Covariance descriptor of the partitions
Construct the covariance descriptor for each community/partition
